# Amazon_Monthly_Sales_Report_Using_Power_BI

**🔎 Project Overview**

This project analyzes Amazon sales data using Power BI.
It highlights product performance, regional sales distribution, profit trends, and customer purchasing behavior.
The dashboard enables business managers, analysts, and decision-makers to explore sales interactively and derive data-driven insights.

**❓ Problem Statement**

E-commerce platforms like Amazon generate large volumes of transactional data daily.
While this data is valuable, it is often stored in raw tables, making it difficult for business users to extract meaningful insights quickly.

👉 An interactive dashboard was needed to simplify analysis and uncover trends in sales, profit, and customer behavior.

**🎯 Goal of the Project**

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for Amazon sales.

Answer key business questions such as:

Which product categories generate the highest revenue and profit?

How do sales and profit vary by region?

What are the monthly/seasonal sales trends?

Which products are top-sellers vs underperformers?

Enable managers to take data-driven actions in sales, marketing, and inventory planning.
